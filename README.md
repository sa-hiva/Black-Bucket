## 🎭 About the Game

**Black Bucket** is a unique puzzle-platformer that reinterprets the digital concept of a **"masking layer"** as a gameplay mechanic. 

In image-editing software, a mask hides or shows content without altering the original image—similar to how a **green screen** works in video production. In this game, your vision is your reality.

### 📜 The Story
After a forceful update implemented an AI tool without consent, a creator's illustrations have been corrupted. As a small scribble, you must chase the malfunctioning **Bucket Tool** and navigate through the digital mess to save the remaining artwork.

## 🕹️ Core Mechanics

The game is built on **exploration** and **trial-and-error**, alternating between two critical phases:

### 🖌️ Phase 1: Drawing
*   **Frozen World:** You cannot move your character.
*   **Ink Limits:** You have a specific amount of ink available.
*   **The Reveal:** Draw **one single stroke** on the mask layer to unveil the hidden platforms behind the darkness.

### 🏃 Phase 2: Platforming
*   **Vision is Reality:** Only the areas you revealed have physical properties. If you can't see it, you can't step on it.
*   **Thinking Outside the Box:** Sometimes the path isn't a platform; sometimes, the best way forward is *through* the void.
