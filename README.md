## About

**Black Bucket** is a game that approaches the *“mask”* theme from the same angle as image-editing software.

In this type of programs, a mask is a layer placed on top of another layer or image. By painting either black or white, it hides or shows the content behind it without altering the original image. A widely known example of a masking layer is the **green screen**, commonly used in video editing software.

The game is a combination of **puzzle** and **platformer**, based mainly on **trial-and-error** and **exploration**.

After a forceful update that implemented an AI tool without asking, the illustrations of a person are spoiled when the bucket tool becomes corrupted. Now, it is the mission of one of the scribbles to chase after the bucket and save its creator’s artworks.

All levels are covered by a mask that completely hides the background, and each level has **two phases**:

###  Drawing Phase
- The player cannot move.
- A limited amount of ink is available.
- The player can draw **one stroke** on the mask layer.
- The stroke reveals the platformer world behind it.

###  Platforming Phase
- The player must reach the end of the level.
- Only the revealed areas exist.
- Platforms are not always necessary — sometimes the best path is *through*.

> **Remember:** nothing exists if it’s not unmasked. Be clever.

Good luck!  
Help the drawings escape from the AI’s corruption!
